# Installation

## Requirements

In its bid for minimalism, Textadept also needs very little to run. In fact, the
only thing it needs is [GTK+ 2.0][GTK2] >= 2.16. Textadept has it's own version
of Lua compiled in.

#### Linux

Most Linux systems already have GTK+ installed. If not, it is probably available
through your package manager. Otherwise, compile and install it from the
[GTK+ website][GTK-Linux].

[GTK2]: http://gtk.org
[GTK-Linux]: http://www.gtk.org/download-linux.html

#### Mac OSX

Prior to 3.5, the GTK+ [Mac OSX Framework][GTK-OSX] was needed. Newer versions
are all-inclusive and do not require anything.

[GTK-OSX]: http://code.google.com/p/textadept/downloads/detail?name=Gtk-Framework-2.14.3-2-test1.dmg

Note that Textadept is designed for Intel Leopard+ Macs.

#### Windows

Windows systems need the [GTK+ 2.0 Runtime][GTK-Runtime] installed.

[GTK-Runtime]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-win/

## Download

Textadept can be downloaded from the [project page][Download]. Select the
appropriate package for your platform.
