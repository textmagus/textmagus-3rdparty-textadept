# Installation

## Requirements

In its bid for minimalism, Textadept also needs very little to run. In fact, the
only thing it needs is [GTK+ 2.0][GTK2] >= 2.16. Textadept has it's own version
of Lua compiled in.

#### Linux

Most Linux systems already have GTK+ installed. If not, it is probably available
through your package manager. Otherwise, compile and install it from the
[GTK+ website][GTK-Linux].

#### Mac OSX

There is a GTK+ [Mac OSX Framework][GTK-OSX] available in contrast to using GTK+
from Fink or DarwinPorts/MacPorts in conjuction with X11. You will need to get
the [latest TESTING framework][GTK-OSX-Latest] that supports versioning. Note
that Textadept is designed for Intel Leopard Macs.

#### Windows

Windows systems need the [GTK+ 2.0 Runtime][GTK-Runtime] installed.
