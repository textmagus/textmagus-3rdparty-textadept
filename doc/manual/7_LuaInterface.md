# Lua Interface

After startup, Textadept relinquishes control to Lua. At this point, having a
Manual is pointless since all of Textadept's functionality is dynamic from here
on out. This is where the most important resource for help comes in: the
[LuaDoc][LuaDoc]. It contains not only documentation for Textadept's Lua API,
but documentation for all of its modules and features as well. It is more up to
date than a manual like this could ever be.
