# File Navigation

## Bookmarks

You can place bookmarks on lines in buffers to jump back to them later. Use the
`Tools -> Bookmark` menu options or key commands to do so.

## Goto Line

To jump to a specific line in a file, press `Ctrl+J` (`⌘J` on Mac OSX | `^J` in
ncurses) and specify the line number in the prompt and press `Enter` (`↩` |
`Enter`) or select `OK`.

## Goto Matching Brace

By default, Textadept will highlight the matching brace characters under the
caret : `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `<`, and `>`. Pressing `Ctrl+M` (`^M` on
Mac OSX | `M-M` in ncurses) moves the caret to that matching brace and
`Ctrl+Shift+M` (`^⇧M` | `M-S-M`) extends the selection.

## Mac OSX and ncurses

Textadept supports the keybindings you are accustomed to for navigating text
fields in Mac OSX and entering commands in the Linux/BSD terminal.
