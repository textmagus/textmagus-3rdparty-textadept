-- ## Fields

-- * `entry_text`: The text in the entry.
--
-- ## Overview
--
-- Access to the Lua state is available through this command entry. It is useful
-- for debugging, inspecting, and entering buffer or view commands. If you try
-- cause instability in Textadept's Lua state, you might very well succeed. Be
-- careful.
--
-- Tab-completion for functions, variables, tables, etc. is available. Press the
-- `Tab` key to display a list of available completions. Use the arrow keys to
-- make a selection and press `Enter` to insert it.
--
-- Note: Use [`textadept.print()`][textadept_print] instead of the global
-- `print()` function. The former prints to a new buffer, the latter to standard
-- out (`STDOUT`).

--
-- ## Extending
--
-- You can extend the command entry to do more than enter Lua commands. An
-- example of this is [incremental search][inc_search]. See `core/ext/find.lua`
-- for the implementation.

-- [inc_search]: ../modules/textadept.find.html#incremental
