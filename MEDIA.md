## Lua Workshop 2012

*Textadept - Behind the Scenes* ([slides][])

Textadept is a fast, minimalist, and ridiculously extensible cross-platform text
editor for programmers. It is written in a combination of C and Lua. Textadept
uses Lua to solve many interesting and complex problems encountered in text
editor design, including syntax highlighting, syntax-based code completion, and
scripting external C libraries and GUI components. This talk will focus on
examining the internals of Textadept, from its innovative LPeg syntax
highlighting engine to the embedded Lua scripting environment that provides
nearly all of the editor's features. Come learn about Textadept and also about
how you can use and extend it to fit your workflow.
